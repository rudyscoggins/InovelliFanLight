# Inovelli Fan + Light Driver

This repository contains a Hubitat driver for the **Inovelli LZW36 Fan/Light Switch**. It is a fork of Inovelli's official code and provides convenient control of both fan and light functions through Hubitat.

## Features
- Control fan speed and light level
- Configure LED notifications, colors and intensity
- Energy and power monitoring
- Exposes child devices for easier dashboard management
- Supports advanced configuration parameters and association groups

## Installation
1. In Hubitat, navigate to **Drivers Code** and select **New Driver**.
2. Copy the contents of `InnovelliFanLightDriver.groovy` and paste them into the driver editor.
3. Save the driver and assign it to your Inovelli LZW36 device.
4. Click **Configure** once to ensure all settings are sent to the switch.

## Usage
After installation the driver exposes commands for controlling the fan and light components individually as well as builtâ€‘in notifications. All parameters can be edited in the device preferences. See the code comments for details on each option.
